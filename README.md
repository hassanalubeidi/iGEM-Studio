#iGEM Studio
iGEM Studio provides an easy way to create an iGEM Wiki. 

Version 0.1 (First minimum viable product): 
This software follows the Agile release methodology, so there will be constant small releases. Versioning goes as follows:
X.Y.Z where 
- X marks a new version of the software entirely, with potentially breaking changes.
- Y marks the adddition of a new feature.
- Z marks a small change/ bug fix. 

*Notice: Versions < 1 are prerelease, so many changes will be breaking. Therefore, Please don't rely on this for live wikis*
